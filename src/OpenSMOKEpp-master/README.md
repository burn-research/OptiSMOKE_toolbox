Welcome to OpenSMOKE++ Framework!
=====================

OpenSMOKE++ is a C++ framework for the numerical simulation of reacting flows with detailed kinetic mechanisms. It is developed by the [CRECK Modeling Group][1] at the Department of Chemistry, Materials, and Chemical Engineering of the Politecnico di Milano (Italy).


Main features
---------

 - **CHEMKIN pre-processor**: the OpenSMOKE++ framework can manage kinetic mechanisms written in the famous CHEMKIN format
 - **thermodynamic properties**: thermodynamic properties of gas species are calculted through the NASA coefficients
 - **kinetic scheme**: the OpenSMOKE++ framework allows to manage very detailed kinetic schemes, with thousands of species and reactions; third-body, fall-off, chemically activated bimolecular reactions are available; Chebyshev polynomials, Log-Pressure dependenciesand additional features can be easily exploited
 - **transport properties**: transport properties of gas species (thermal conductivity, dynamic viscosity, mass diffusion coefficients, thermal diffusion coefficients) can be accurately calculated on the basis of the kinetic theory of gases; several mixing rules are available
 - **heterogeneous reactions**: heterogeneous reactions (i.e. gas/solid reactions) are implemented according to the CHEMKIN format
